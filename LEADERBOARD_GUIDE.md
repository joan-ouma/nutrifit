# 🏆 FitFork Leaderboard - Complete Guide

## How It Works (Simple Explanation)

The leaderboard **automatically ranks users** based on how well they track their nutrition. **No manual check-ins needed!** It updates in real-time whenever someone logs a meal.

## 🎯 Scoring Breakdown

### 1. Meal Logging (Base Points)
- **10 points per meal logged**
- Example: Log 4 meals = 40 points
- **Why?** Encourages consistent tracking

### 2. Calorie Goal Achievement
- **Perfect (within 5% of goal)** = 50 points
  - Goal: 2000 cal → Eat 1900-2100 cal = 50 pts
- **Close (within 10%)** = 30 points
  - Goal: 2000 cal → Eat 1800-2200 cal = 30 pts
- **Near (within 15%)** = 10 points
  - Goal: 2000 cal → Eat 1700-2300 cal = 10 pts
- **Outside 15%** = 0 points
- **Why?** Rewards hitting your calorie targets

### 3. Macro Balance (Protein, Carbs, Fats)
- **Each macro goal met** = 25 points
- **Perfect Day (all 3 macros balanced)** = 100 bonus points
- **Why?** Encourages balanced nutrition

### 4. Streak Bonus
- **5 points × consecutive days**
- Day 1: 5 points
