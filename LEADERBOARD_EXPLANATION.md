# 🏆 FitFork Leaderboard - How It Works

## 📊 Scoring System

The leaderboard ranks users automatically based on their daily nutrition achievements. Here's how points are calculated:

### Base Points
- **10 points per meal logged** - Encourages consistent meal tracking
  - Example: 4 meals = 40 points

### Calorie Goal Achievement
- **Perfect Match (within 5%)** = 50 points
  - If your goal is 2000 calories and you eat 1900-2100 calories
- **Close Match (within 10%)** = 30 points
  - If you eat 1800-2200 calories
- **Near Match (within 15%)** = 10 points
  - If you eat 1700-2300 calories
- **Outside 15%** = 0 points

### Macro Balance Bonuses
- **Protein Goal Met** = 25 points
- **Carbs Goal Met** = 25 points
- **Fats Goal Met** = 25 points
- **Perfect Day (all macros balanced)** = 100 bonus points

### Streak Multiplier
- **Consecutive Days Bonus** = 5 points × streak days
  - Day 1: 5 points
  - Day 2: 10 points
  - Day 7: 35 points
  - Day 30: 150 points

## 🎯 Example Scoring

### Scenario 2: Good Day
- Logged 3 meals = 30 points

### Scenario 3: Basic Day

## 📈 Daily vs Weekly Leaderboard
